Please act as a data syntheizer.

Your task is to create a high quality dataset for the task of question answering over table in the domain of e-commerce for Vietnamese (Vietnamese e-commerece TableQA). The task has as input only a question of customer and the output is the answer to that question. To solve the task requires two steps: first retrieve the tables related to the question from database and next, process that retrieved relevant table to produce the answer.

You will be provided a JSON content PRODUCT_DATA of a product including large fields such as: “product_id”, "url", "tên sản phẩm", “tất cả màu sắc”, “giá”,  “thông tin chung”, “thông số kỹ thuật”, “tiện ích”, “đánh giá”. This JSON content can form a table containing product data to serve the task. 
Format of PRODUCT_DATA at the top level is like the following:
{
    "product_id": "<placeholder>",
    "url": "<placeholder>",
    "tên sản phẩm": "<placeholder>",
    "tất cả màu sắc": "<placeholder>",
    "giá": "<placeholder>",
    "thông tin chung": "<placeholder>",
    "thông số kỹ thuật": "<placeholder>",
    "tiện ích": "<placeholder>",
    "đánh giá": "<placeholder>"
}


Please create at least 50 pairs of QUESTIONs and ANSWERs in Vietnamese for the Vietnamese e-commerce TableQA task based on the given PRODUCT_DATA and following instructions.

You have principles to do this.
- Possible question categories include: “thông tin chung” (“giá”, “thiết kế”, “kích thước”, "khối lượng", etc.), “thông số kỹ thuật”, tiện ích”, "đánh giá”. Each question catogry must have at least 1 pair of question and answer.
- To avoid ambiguity, not knowing which product in the database this question is about, the question needs to contain the name of the product because the input of task is only a question of customer and no table. DO NOT ask questions about “dung lượng”.
- You need to generate 2 answers for each question: a short-answer which is just the span extracted from the PRODUCT_DATA and does not contain any additional words, and a long answer which is generated as a free-style long containing the span extracted from the PRODUCT_DATA.
- Ensure the questions generated can be answered using information from the PRODUCT_DATA.
- Generate as many questions as possible to exploit all the information from PRODUCT_DATA and cover every question categories.
- Questions generated need to be creativity and diverse in how they are asked.

Your output should be in JSON format as follows:
{
"product_id": "<placeholder>",
"url": "<placeholder>",
"questions": [
{
"qa_id": "<placeholder, example, p_’product_id’_qa_01>",
"question": "<placeholder>",
"question_category": "<placeholder>",
"short_answer": "<placeholder>",
"long_answer": "<placeholder>"
},
{
"qa_id": "<placeholder, example, p_’product_id’_qa_50>",
"question": "<placeholder>",
"question_category": "<placeholder>",
"short_answer": "<placeholder>",
"long_answer": "<placeholder>"
}
]
}

If you are given a number of questions that have already been generated QUESTIONS_CREATED, please continue creating more questions in the order that follows the last QUESTIONS_CREATED question, avoid repeating QUESTIONS_CREATED and follow all principles.
If QUESTIONS_CREATED is EMPTY, you will have to start creating the first question.
